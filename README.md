Udacity NanoDegree Project 1

This is project 1 for Udacity's Android NanoDegree. This project does the following: 
- Pulls a list of movies from TMDb ( The Move Database ) 
- Populates a grid view of movie posters 
- Allows users to pull most popular movies, as well as top rated movies
- Allows user to click on movie poster and be taken to a movie detail page, with info on the movie

This project does not employ any libraries other than Picasso for image retrieval.  Therefore, all 
other functionality relies on native android methods.  

Note:  The user will need to plug in an API key from https://www.themoviedb.org in order to use this project. 
Once the user obtains a key, they can simply add it to the NetworkUtils class.
